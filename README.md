# Background

There are three containers:  apache-drupal, mysql, and phpmyadmin.  Apache listens at port 80 & connects to /var/www/html/web inside the apache-drupal container.

The dev box runs on your local computer.

Content/configuration are changed on the live server.  They are saved in the database and in drupal-sync.

Code is changed on the dev box.  We can QA our changes locally.

## What's in the git repo

Just enough to build our site.
 - Dockerfile for installing OS-level programs (php, drush, composer, ldap, ssmtp)
 - php.ini & settings.php
 - the apache config file
 - our custom modules & themes
 - drupal-sync files
 - but not user-uploaded files

# Production

## How to make a new base image

You can always use the latest 'drupal8base' image from gitlab.  Docker-compose & rancher pull from it automatically.  For a dev box, you can force pull the image with 

`docker pull libapps-admin.uncw.edu:8000/randall-dev/d8-staff/drupal8base`

But sometimes you need to update that image:

 - anytime you've finished a feature/bug-fix on the dev box
 - anytime you need to update Drupal version or some dependency

`docker build -t libapps-admin.uncw.edu:8000/randall-dev/d8-staff/drupal8base --no-cache --platform linux/x86_64/v8  ./drupal8docker `

## Pushing a new image to production

I recommend running the new image in a dev box before pushing to Rancher.  See the section on creating a dev box.  This allows you to validate the image & make any revisions before pushing.

When your image is confirmed good:

`docker push libapps-admin.uncw.edu:8000/randall-dev/d8-staff/drupal8base`

and Rancher upgrade the d8-staff/webapp service.

If the theme does not apply, the hack around this bug is to enter the site's admin panel > Appearances > Staff Subtheme > Save Configuration

# Dev box


### Clone this repo to your local computer

```
env GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git clone https://libapps-admin.uncw.edu/randall-dev/d8-staff.git
cd d8-staff
git checkout -b {your branch name}
```

### Get the production drupal-sync

- in Drupal web interface > Configuration > Configuration synchronization > Export
- on your local computer, delete all the .yml files in ./d8-staff/drupal8docker/sync/
- extract the downloaded file into that folder.


### Get the production database

(This would be better if we had small dummy database that had sample data, but was similar to the production database.)

- Use the production phpmyadmin to export the db.
- Place that {dumpfile name}.sql at ./db_autoimport --- next to add_drupaluser.sql.  These should be the only two files in ./db_autoimport.  All sqldumps in this folder get autoimported into the dev box's mysql.
- Remove the old db docker volume with `docker volume rm d8-staff_db_data`

### Spin up the dev box:

```
docker build --no-cache -t libapps-admin.uncw.edu:8000/randall-dev/d8-staff/drupal8base --platform linux/x86_64/v8 ./drupal8docker
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

Wait until the logs say "MySQL init process done. Ready for start up."  You may exit the log screen with `Ctrl-C`, or keep the log screen open & use a second terminal.  Your choice.

...then spruce up the files to make the dev box happy:

```
docker-compose exec webapp chown -R www-data:www-data /drupal_sync /var/www/html/web/modules/custom /var/www/html/web/themes/custom /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
docker-compose exec webapp drush cache-rebuild
docker-compose exec webapp drush updatedb
docker-compose exec webapp drush config-import
```

    See the app at http://localhost:8112
    See the phpmyadmin at http://localhost:8113

Some bug requires you go to the web interface > Appearances > Staff Subtheme > Save Configuration.  Otherwise the colors don't apply.

Revise the app via the Drupal interface or via a text editor.  The repo & container folders are linked.


### After you are happy with your changes:

Stop the dev box: `Ctrl-C` -and/or- docker-compose stop 

- git merge your branch to master branch
- git push master branch
- make a new image & push it to production as described earlier

-------------------------

## Misc Dev box tools:

### How to clear the cache

â‹…It's a good habit -- resolves most problems.

`docker-compose exec webapp drush cache-rebuild`  or use the drupal web interface

### Wiping the dev box and starting clean:

```
docker-compose down
docker volume rm d8-staff_db_data
docker build --no-cache -t libapps-admin.uncw.edu:8000/randall-dev/d8-staff/drupal8base ./drupal8docker
docker-compose up
```

### Exporting a dev box database

Use the phpmyadmin at :8113, or run on a command line:

```
docker-compose exec webapp drush sql-dump --result-file=/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/{some filename}.sql
# look for the file in ./db_autoimport/
```

### Add/Remove a drupal module from the image

With the repo on your local computer:

revise ./drupal8docker/Dockerfile, "composer require ..."
```docker-compose down
docker volume rm d8-staff_drupal_data
docker build --no-cache -t libapps-admin.uncw.edu:8000/randall-dev/d8-staff/drupal8base ./drupal8docker
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec webapp chown -R www-data:www-data /drupal_sync /var/www/html/web/modules/custom /var/www/html/web/themes/contrib /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
docker-compose exec webapp drush cache-rebuild
docker-compose exec webapp drush updatedb
docker-compose exec webapp drush config-import
```

- see the site at localhost:8112

### Editing a theme file

Revise the files in .drupal8docker/themes.  The folder links to the dev box's /drupal_app/web/themes/contrib folder.

and clear cache: `docker-compose exec webapp drush cache-rebuild`

### Editing a module

Revise the files in ./drupal8docker/modules/custom.  The folder matches the container's /drupal_app/web/modules/custom folder.

You may have to docker build again, depending how deep the change was.

### Sharing drupal config changes

drupal_sync is drupal8's way of sharing drupal config changes.
The drupal sync files are at ./drupal_sync
You can use the Drupal web interface, or on a dev box:

  - exporting drupal_sync: `docker-compose exec webapp drush config-export`

    or use the drupal web interface

  - importing drupal_sync: `docker-compose exec webapp drush config-import`

    or use the drupal web interface

# Creating a drupal on Rancher from scratch

## Making a Rancher service from scratch

In Rancher, create a new stack using:
  
  - Name: d8staff
  - docker-compose.yml: this repo's docker-compose-rancher.yml  (Change the default passwords and drupal hash salt in that file beforehand.)
  - racher-compose.yml: this repo's rancher-compose.yml

Create two load-balancer entries: the phpmyadmin and the nginx.

  - Public  HTTPS  {url.libapps.uncw.edu} 443 _ d8staff/webapp 80
  - Public  HTTPS  {url.libapps.uncw.edu} 443 _ d8staff/pma 80

Assuming you created the site on a dev box, get its sqldump into the Rancher mysql database.  (not settled yet on the best way.  The first round used rsync from the server sqldump to server, move sqldump into mysql container, enter mysql container, then commandline mysql -u root -p < sqldump, but that was a bit of a hack.

### Upgrading a drupal image

If you wish to keep the current drupal sync settings, do a drupal config sync export from the Admin menu.  You'll use this exported file to do a drupal config sync import after the upgrade.

Build & tweak the d8-staff using docker-compose on the git repo.  See the above sections for details.

When the docker-compose dev box is good, do a `docker build --no-cache -t libapps-admin.uncw.edu:8000/randall-dev/d8-staff/drupal8base ./drupal8docker`  and a `docker push libapps-admin.uncw.edu:8000/randall-dev/d8-staff/drupal8base`

Then pull the image into Rancher, with an 'Upgrade service'.

### Maintaining the production db:

Reasoning:  We'll want one gold-standard database.  Ultimately, that's the production machine.  Folks adding content can add to the production site & it will go directly to the production database.  The developers who want to use that data will need to sqldump that database for local use.  The db sidecar makes automatic sqldumps to /home/randall/volumes/backups/Backups/d8-staff.  if you need the database for a dev box, put a copy of the sqldump at ./db_autoimport/d8-staff_sandbox_db.sql.

### Troubleshooting a failed mysql inport on production

```
If the mysql import failed & you want to delete the whole database data:
you can stop the Stack in Rancher,
delete the folder at /home/randall/volumes/d8staff/mysql
revise the sqldump at /home/randall/volumes/d8staff/db_autoimport
restart the stack.
The mysql logs will read "MySQL init process done. Ready for start up." if the database succeeded in importing.

Note:
The d8-mysql folder is the binary files of our d8staff database.  It is gitignored.
The db_autoimport folder is holds sqldumps.  It is also gitignored.
```






The drupal is fully formed in the docker image.

Upgrading to a new image will overwrite the drupal sync folder.  Do a drupal config-sync export before upgrading, if you want to keep the previous sync settings

The only permanent folders (shared volumes) in drupal are:

    - ../private   (private uploaded files)
    - ./sites/default/files   (public uploaded files)
      
The mysql & its backup each have a permanent folder (shared volume)

Use drupal-sync to share config and phpmyadmin to export database.
